Write a Program that simulates a telephone that records missed incoming calls.

 For each missed call, store the time of call, telephone number of origin, and name of the caller if the name is available. 

 For unlisted numbers, set the name to “private caller”. 
 
Choose or extend the most
appropriate collection class and provide the following features.

a. Numbers are recalled in the order they arrive

b. Up to 10 numbers are recorded. When the eleventh call comes in, it is stored and the
oldest call is deleted so that no more than 10 numbers are ever recorded.

c. After each number display, the user can select

    i. To delete the call
    ii. To go on to the next missed call, or
    iii. To display the call details (number, caller name and time). Delete the number                        if user specifies a number to delete.


Write a helper class to represent an incoming call with fields to hold the number, name of the
caller, and time of the call.
Write a tester call that stores the several numbers, simulate the user
pressing the missed-calls button, and finally prints the entire collection of stored calls.
